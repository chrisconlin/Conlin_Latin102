Review
purpose clauses
relative clauses
verbal expressions with participles
expressing purpose using ad plus the gerundive
Background
You already know the background to this story: Deianira was tricked by Nessus into believing that the vial of poison he gave her was actually a love potion.

Instructions
Your composition should use at least two participles and two relative clauses.
Your composition should include at least one expression of purpose using ad + a noun or pronoun modified by a gerundive.
Your first sentence should use a negative purpose clause to say that when Deianira, the daughter of Oeneus and the wife of Hercules saw that the beautiful young girl Iole had been brought (to her house), she began to devise a plot in order not to lose her husband (or “be deprived of” her husband).

"When Deinira, the daughter of Oeneus and the wife of Hercules, saw that the beautiful young girl Iole, had been brought (to her house), she began to devide a plot in order not to lose her husband (or "be deprived of her husband). 

*When Denira saw 

**that Iole had been brought

She began to devise a plan

*in order not to lose her husband

temporal clause (cum...+indicative for time, subjunctive for circumstance). We know that it is secondary sequence and we will go with the pluperfect as we can make the case that the time relation of subordinate clause is earlier. To see is: videō, vidēre, vīdī, visus. We will look for the 3rd person, singular, plurperfect, active, subjunctive. That being said, it is "vidisset". So, thus far we have "Cum Deinira vidisset." We can also begin to add some of the other details such as "the daughter of Oeneus and the wife of Hercules." This is a simple use of nominative subjects and genitive use as an appositve. This will translate to: "filia Oeni et uxor Herculis." Putting this temporal clause together, we have: "Cum Deinira, filia Oeni et uxor Herculis, vidisset." 

Indirect statement: "that the beautiful young girl Iole had been brought." We need an infinitive with accusitive subject. Lolen+infintiive which we need a perfect passive infinitive which is adductus/a/um esse. So, it becomes "lolen adductam esse." For beautiful and young we need the accustive and to match "girl" as feminine gender which would be "bellam" and "iuvenem". Adding the other details we get "Lolen iuvenem bellam adductam esse" 

So, thus far in this first sentence we have "Cum Deinira, filia Oeni et uxor Herculis, vidisset Lolel iuvenem bellam adductam esse"

For the purpose clause ("in order not to lose her husband) we will use ne + subjunctive. The tense follows sequence of tenses for secondary (past) sequence. That being said, we need the imperfect subjunctive passive 3rd person singular. Privo, privare, privavi, privatus = "to deprive someone of something (abl.) The correct form of the verb is "privaretur and the ablative form of husband is "marito." That being said, the purpose clause becomes "ne privaretur marito." 

For the independent clause ("she began to devise a plot") we need a finite verb in the indicative. Machinor, machinari,-, machinatus (2nd principal part is what we need "to plot" of this deponent verb). Coepio, coepere, coepi, coeptus, we will go with the imperfect as it can be argued that it is occuring more than just once and then stopped, "she began" as in a continuing action which would be coepiebat. This would then become "Deianira coepiebat machinari."

Putting it all togethter for the first sentence we have: "Cum Deinira, filia Oeni et uxor Herculis, vidisset Lolen iuvenem bellam adductam esse, Deianira coepiebat machinari ne privaretur marito."





Your second sentence should express that she sent her servant to bring to Hercules a garment dipped in the blood of the centaur Nessus, which she thought was a love potion.
"Deinira sent her servant for the purpose of bringing Herclues a garment that was dipped in the blood of the centaur Nessus, which she thought was a love potion."

"Deinira." mittō, mittere, mīsī, missus - to send. We need the 3rd person, perfect, active indicative which is "misit." We need the accusative singular form of famulus, famuli (m.) “servant” which is "famulum." So for the beginning part of this independent clause we have "Deinira misit famulum." We are going to use a Gerund-Replacing Gerundives (GRGs) for this next part of the sentence "For the purpose of bringing Hercules a garment." In order to do this we will construct it using "ad" + the gerund. When translating GRGs, the gerundive is translated just like a gerund and the noun that agrees with it as its a direct object. So to bring is ferō, ferre, tulī, lātus. The gerundive matching in the accustive is "ferendum." We need the ccustive forms for Herculies and Germanet which is "Herculem" and "vestimentum." So, our statment so far is "Deinira misit famulum ad ferendum Herculem vestimentum." 

We then will work on the indirect statement "that was cleaned in the blood of the centaur Nessus." We need the perfect active infinitive of to clean "mundo, mundas, mundavi, mundatum. (NOTE: I am using to clean instead of to dip because I could not find the gloss for "to dip". So, the perfect activie infinitive is "mundavisse." We then will us in + acc of blood (sanguinem) and the genitive of both centaur and Nessus which is "centauri" and "Nessi." So, this is the indiret statment: "mundavisse in sanguinem centauri Nessi." 

So far we have "Deinira misit famulum ad ferendum Herculem vestimentum mundavisse in sanguinem centauri Nessi" 

For the last part we need to translate, "which she thought was a love potion." For the relative clause we will use "quam" because it is referring to the garment which is the direct object in the sentence. putō, putāre, putāvī, putātus - to think. We will go with the pluperfect subjunctive because she previosuly thought that it was a love potion before she decided to send the servant. That being said the 3rd person, singular, pluperfect, active, subjunctive is "putaverit." Love potion is philtrum, i (n): “love potion”. So the accustive is philtrum. so it is "quam putaverit philtrum." 

The second sentence translates to: "Deinira misit famulum ad ferendum Herculem vestimentum mundavisse in sanguinem centauri Nessi, quam putaverit philtrum." 








Your third sentence should say that Hercules put the garment on and it immediately burst into flames.
"Hercules put the garment on and it immediately bursted into flames." induo, induĕre, indui, indutum “put on an article of dress or ornament”. "We will use the 3rd person, perfect, active indicative which is just "induit." We need the accustive of garment which is "vestimentum." So, it is "Hercules induit vestimentum." "Et" for and. "Statim" is the adverb for immediately. (((((I would like to use a participle to make it "which immediately bursted into flames.")))) In + acc can be into flames. in + flammo, flammare, flammavi, flammatus “flame, burn” becomes?????"



Your fourth sentence should express that Hercules threw the slave, whom Deianira had sent to bring the garment back, into the sea.
For this sentence, the independent clause is just "Hercules threw the slave into the sea." "Hercules." iaciō, iacere, iēcī, iactus - to throw, hurl. The 3rd person, singular, perfect, activive, indiciative is iecit. The accusative direct object is the slave or servant which is "famulum." In + acc of mare, maris, n. - sea is "in maren". So it is "Hercules iecit fumulum in maren." To add the subordinate clause, we will use "quem" as the relative clause because it is referring to the anecent which is the servant which is the accusative direct object. "Deianira" is the nominaitve subject. mittō, mittere, mīsī, missus - to send. Perfect active indivcative third person singular is "misit." We need the present active infinitive of ferō, ferre, tulī, lātus - to bear, carry, bring which is "ferre". Once again, we need garment in the accusative which is "vestimentum."

So, this fourth sentence translates to: "Hercules iecit famulum, quem Deianira misit ferre vestimentum, in maren."

Your last sentence should express that it is reported (or said) that Hercules rose to immortality, but Deianira killed herself on account of this deed.
