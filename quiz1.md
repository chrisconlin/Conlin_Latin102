Part 1: recognizing nouns

Identify the gender, case and number, and gender of each noun. If there are multiple possible forms, list all options. Translate prepositional phrases.

Filiam

Filia, filiae, f = Daughter. It is a first declension noun. That being said, “filiam” is first declension, singular, feminine, and accusative. 

in coniugium
conjugium, conjugii n. It is a second declension noun and it is neuter. That being said, it is neuter, singular, accusative, and 2nd declension. One could think that it is also nominative singular but we know that the preposition phrase must match with the accusative. Knowing that it is accusative, this prepositional phrase is an Accusative of place to which or motion toward. Therefore, it should translate to “into marriage” 

Animo
Animus, animi. Noun masculine. It is a 2nd declension and it is masculine. That being said, it is masculine, 2nd declension, singular, and it can either be dative or ablative. 

Uirgine
virgo, virginis f: young woman. It is a 3rd declension feminine noun. That being said, it is 3rd declension, feminine, singular, ablative. 

Parentes
parens, parentis m: parent. This is a 3rd declension, masculine, plural. That being said, it could either be nominative plural or accusative plural, but it is certainly 3rd declension, masculine or feminine, plural. 

ad uxorem
uxor, uxoris f: wife. The “ad” indicates that it is accusative of place to which or motion toward. Wife is 3rd declension feminine singular. That being said, it is 3rd declension, singular, feminine, and accusative. It must translate to “towards the wife”
