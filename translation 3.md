Translation 3: Hercules’ sixth task
Glossary and notes
Note: the verb sum, esse, fui, futurus has no present participle! If you want to construct the equivalent of a normal verbal unit using a participle with a noun, you can simply omit the verb “to be” and include the predicate (just as you can with finite forms of sum: Herculis fortis could be a complete sentence). This is most easily recognizable when the noun is an ablative in ablative absolute construction.

Vocabulary:

Augeas, Augeae (m), Augeas, king of Elis
bobile, bobilis (n), “stall”
caro, carnis (f), “flesh, meat”
Iuppiter, Iovis (m), Jupiter
purgo, purgare, purgavi, purgatus, “to clean (something, from something else)” Note that purgo can take two accusative direct objects.
quattuor (indeclinable adj.), “four”
stercus, stercoris (n), “dung, manure”
Passage to analyze
Hyginus, chapter 30, section 7.

Augeae regis stercus bobile uno die purgavit, maiorem partem Iove adiutore; flumine admisso totum stercus abluit. taurum cum quo Pasiphae concubuit ex Creta insula Mycenis vivum adduxit. Diomedem Thraciae regem et equos quattuor eius, qui carne humana vescebantur, cum Abdero famulo interfecit; equorum autem nomina Podargus Lampon Xanthus Dinus.

B. Grammatical questions
In the phrase, Iove adiutore, what case is Iove? What kind of construction is this phrase

>>Iove is in the ablative case and it is being used in an ablative absolute construction. "While Jupiter was his helper..." 

What case is stercus, and why is it in that case?

>>stercus is in the accusative case because it is serving as the direct object. 

Identify the form of the adjective maiorem (gender, case, number, degree).

>>the adjectvive maiorem is accusative singular feminine and serving as the irregular comparative

Explain the construction of the verbal unit flumine admisso.
>> both are in the abaltive case so it is being used as an abaltive absolute (i.e. "after the river had been let in")

What are the gender, number, case, and antecedent of qui?
>>It is masculine, plural, nomintive and the antecedent is equos. 

What Latin verb form has to be understood in the clause that runs from equorum to Dinus?
>>A form of sum "to be". The horses names "were"


C. Literary commentary
Choose two choices of syntax, word order, or diction that Hyginus makes in this passage that complement or enhance the meaning of the passage’s content. Discuss briefly s in 3-4 sentences. Italicize Latin words when citing them.

>>an interesting thing that I noticed that Hyginus did was in the 9th section he included the use of "cum Abdero famulo." Normally, when I see cum I immediately think it will be a part of a temporal clause. However, Hyginus is having cum be placed next two these two abaltive forms so that it would become "with" instead of a form of time like "when."

>>another cool thing that Hyginus uses is the irregular comparative of maiorem. Just by using this one word, we know that Jupiter helped him clean the stall for the majority of the time. This one word helps us get a much better of the situation and just how much Jupiter aided in cleaning the manure.
