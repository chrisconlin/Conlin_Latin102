Translation 3: Hercules’ sixth task
Glossary and notes
Note: the verb sum, esse, fui, futurus has no present participle! If you want to construct the equivalent of a normal verbal unit using a participle with a noun, you can simply omit the verb “to be” and include the predicate (just as you can with finite forms of sum: Herculis fortis could be a complete sentence). This is most easily recognizable when the noun is an ablative in ablative absolute construction.

Vocabulary:

Augeas, Augeae (m), Augeas, king of Elis
bobile, bobilis (n), “stall”
caro, carnis (f), “flesh, meat”
Iuppiter, Iovis (m), Jupiter
purgo, purgare, purgavi, purgatus, “to clean (something, from something else)” Note that purgo can take two accusative direct objects.
quattuor (indeclinable adj.), “four”
stercus, stercoris (n), “dung, manure”

Diomedem Thraciae regem et equos quattuor eius, qui carne humana vescebantur, cum Abdero famulo interfecit; equorum autem nomina Podargus Lampon Xanthus Dinus.
