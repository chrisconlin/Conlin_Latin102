As you did in translation 2, please select two choices of syntax, word order, or diction that Hyginus makes from anywhere in your Latin reading, and comment briefly on how Hyginus’ choice complements or enhances the meaning of the passage’s content.

Discuss briefly: no more than 2-4 sentences for each example. Italicize Latin words when citing them.

You may select examples from anything you have looked at in Hyginus, from the narrative of his 12 deeds in chapter 30, or the story of his death in chapter 36.

"Leonem Nemeum, quem Luna nutrierat in antro amphistomo atrotum, necauit, cuius pellem pro tegumento habuit."

>>In section 2 of Hyginus' Chapter 30, I wanted to point out the detail added about Luna. In this section of the text, it is telling us about how Hercules killed the Nemean Lion. In addition to this information, Hyginus also uses a relative pronoun to add further detail about the Lion in that it was nurtured by Luna. Luna is the personification of the moon as a Goddess. Since Hyginus does not refer to Luna any more throughout the rest of Chapter 30, perhaps he stylistically included this detail to hint at a rivalry between Hercules and Luna because even though Luna typically defies a mortal like Hercules, Hercules is appearing to get the upper hand in this battle by killing the Lion and I think Hyginus wanted to subtly point that out.


"Augeae regis stercus bobile uno die purgauit, maiorem partem Ioue adiutore; flumine ammisso totum stercus abluit."

>>In section 7, I pointed out in my translation that I thought it was interesting/funny that Hyginus included that Jove helped him clean the stall "for the most part." I wanted to highlight the entire sentence and reflect on its role in the broader context of the chapter. So far in the 12 deeds, Hercules has had some violent tasks such as killing the Erymanthian Boar and then the Stymphalian birds. Now Hyginus is describing how he had to clean poop out of the stalls. I think the placement of this sentence is somewhat humourous because we are reading about Hercules doing all of these brave and heroic tasks and then he goes right into this gross and tedious task. Why do you think Hyginus did that and if he is able to kill the Erymanthian Boar and the Stymahlian birds by himself, why does he need Jove's help cleaning the stall?
