Translation: 
Deianira, the wife of Hercules, could not cross the great river, which was named Evenus, and the centaur Nessus, who was the son of Ixion and Nubes, she asked him for help. After she had been carried up in the river itself he wanted to rape her. When Hercules came to this place and when Deianira implored his help, he pierced Nessus with his arrows.

As he was dying, when he knew that the great potent arrows of the Hydra Lerna have been soaked in posinous liquid, he removed his own blood and gave it to Deianira and said that it was a love potion.

B. Grammatical questions
Identify the antecedent of cui, and its gender and number. Then explain what case cui is, and how it functions in the relative clause. (I.e., why is cui in this case?)
Cui is a relative pronoun (who, which, that) and the antecendent is magnum which is neuter and singlular. Cui matches the antecedent in gender and number but it is used with the dative case as it is serving as the "winner/losers" case. Also it can be possessive to (it's name was).
