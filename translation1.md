A. Grammatical analysis  ❌ *Please use markdown to indicate level of indication unambigously: use `>` at the beginning of the line for one level, `>>` for two levels, etc.*

Place each clause on a separate line, indented to show its level of subordination. Italicize the verb of each clause. For example, if you were given the English sentence, “They felt relieved when they realized that the translation was easy.”, you would format it as
They felt relieved
when they realized
that the translation was easy.

Hercules 

>cum in hospitium ad Dexamenum regem *uenisset*
  
> eiusque filiam Deianiram *deuirginasset*,
        
*volebat* eam uxorem ducere. 

> cum Hercules *abesset*, 
        
centaurus Eurytion *petit* Deianiram uxorem. 

>quia pater eius centaurum *timebat*, 
        
*pollicitus est* 

>se *daturum*.
        
        
Tempore certo, *venit* centaurus cum fratribus ad nuptias.


Hercules *interuenit* 

et centaurum *interfecit*, 

Deianiram *abduxit*.


B. Grammatical questions 
Write a dictionary entry (nominative singular, genitive singular, gender) for Dexamenum, then identify the form Dexamenum.
Dexamenus, dexameni, masculine. The form presented is accusative singular (It is a name). 👍 *(but let's capitalize genitive s., too, for a name)*


Write a dictionary entry (nominative singular, genitive singular, gender) for Deianiram, then identify the form Deianiram.
Deianira, deianirae, feminine. The form presented is accustive singular. (It is also a name) 👍 *(but let's capitalize genitive s., too, for a name)*


Identify the form abesset, and explain why it is this tense and mood.
Third person, singular, imperfect, active, subjunctive. It is subjunctive and it is a part of a temporal clause relating to circumstance. The tense of the main clause is secondary sequence and the time relation to of subordinate clause is later (could be same time as well). ❌


Identify the form uenisset, and explain why it is this tense and mood.
third-person singular pluperfect active subjunctive. We need the pluperfect subjunctive here because it is expressing an action that happened prior to the action of the independent clause. It is subjunctive because it is emphasizing circumstance. 👍 *But maybe better to reverse order of your explanation: it makes  no sense to choose a tense of the subjunctive until you know you need the subjunctive!*


Identify the form pollicitus est. What dictionary form would you look under to find this verb?
You would look for polliceor, pollicēri, -, pollicitus: to promise. Pollicitus est is a 3rd person, singular, perfect, passive, indicative. 




Identify the form of the noun-adjective phrase tempore certo, and explain why it is in this case.
tempus, temporis n: time
certus, a, um: settled time (ablative). We know it's ablative not dative because we don’t use it for time expressions. It is an expression of time “at that given moment…”
