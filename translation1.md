A. Grammatical analysis 
Place each clause on a separate line, indented to show its level of subordination. Italicize the verb of each clause. For example, if you were given the English sentence, “They felt relieved when they realized that the translation was easy.”, you would format it as
They felt relieved
when they realized
that the translation was easy.

Hercules 

        cum in hospitium ad Dexamenum regem uenisset 
  
        eiusque filiam Deianiram deuirginasset,
volebat eam uxorem ducere.

pollicitus est 
se daturum.
Tempore certo, venit centaurus cum fratribus ad nuptias. 
Hercules interuenit 
et centaurum interfecit, 
Deianiram abduxit.
B. Grammatical questions 
Write a dictionary entry (nominative singular, genitive singular, gender) for Dexamenum, then identify the form Dexamenum.
Dexamenus, dexameni, masculine. The form presented is accusative singular (It is a name). 


Write a dictionary entry (nominative singular, genitive singular, gender) for Deianiram, then identify the form Deianiram.
Deianira, deianirae, feminine. The form presented is accustive singular. (It is also a name)


Identify the form abesset, and explain why it is this tense and mood.
Third person, singular, imperfect, active, subjunctive. It is subjunctive because it is secondary sequence, referring to circumstance and not time, and same time relation of subordinate clause. 


Identify the form uenisset, and explain why it is this tense and mood.
third-person singular pluperfect active subjunctive. We need the pluperfect subjunctive here because it is expressing an action that happened prior to the action of the independent clause. It is subjunctive because it is emphasizing circumstance. 


Identify the form pollicitus est. What dictionary form would you look under to find this verb?
You would look for polliceor, pollicēri, -, pollicitus: to promise. Pollicitus est is a 3rd person, singular, perfect, passive, indicative. 




Identify the form of the noun-adjective phrase tempore certo, and explain why it is in this case.
tempus, temporis n: time
certus, a, um: settled time (ablative). We know it's ablative not dative because we don’t use it for time expressions. It is an expression of time “at that given moment…”
